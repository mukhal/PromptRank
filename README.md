Few-shot Reranking for Multi-hop QA via Language Model Prompting

We propose an approach for unsupervised re-ranking of multi-hop document paths for open-domain QA. PromptRank constructs a prompt that consists of **(i) an instruction** and **(ii) the path** and uses a language model to score paths as probability of generating the question given the path.
